## 📅 2026-05-31: Stage 1 Kanban Implementation & Navigation Setup

### What went well
- Created a standard Markdown-based `kanban.md` that traces tasks back to the 7-Stage Framework.
- Updated the centralized navigation menus (`navigation_config.json`, fallback JSON objects in `index.html`, and `markdown_renderer.html`) to expose the Kanban board as a direct debug option.
- Verified how `markdown_renderer.html` resolves directory paths (defaults to `README.md`) and correctly formatted links.

### Gaps & Challenges
- Navigation fallbacks are duplicated in `index.html` and `markdown_renderer.html`. In the future, it might be cleaner to isolate the fallback menu logic to a shared JS utility, but keeping them synchronized manually works for now and maintains resilience.

### Takeaway for Future AI Agents
- When completing tasks, make sure to update the status of the tasks in `1_Real_Unknown/kanban.md` using matching commit messages.

## 📅 2026-05-31: Stage 1 Cost Tracker Setup

### What went well
- Established a unified structure to track both system infrastructure costs and API token consumption in `1_Real_Unknown/costs.md`.
- Kept navigation fallbacks in sync so that the project menu operates reliably.

### Gaps & Challenges
- Estimates for Key Vault and container execution can fluctuate. Agents should update the log on every significant run/operation to prevent budget surprises.

## 📅 2026-05-31: Agent Git Rule & Error Resolution Update

### What went well
- Clarified the requirement for git error resolution across all core agent documentation (`agents.md`, `gemini.md`, `claude.md`, `copilot.md`, `kilocode.md`).
- Practiced granular commit-and-push cycles for each file modification.

### Gaps & Challenges
- None. Maintaining step-by-step git push commands helps identify remote changes or conflicts early.

## 📅 2026-05-31: Console Debugging & Debug Menu Sync Update

### What went well
- Added custom `debugLog` function to output descriptive messages into browser console when debug mode (`debug=true` cookie) is active.
- Documented Debug Menu synchronization rule across all agent personas to prevent stale menu links when markdown documents are added or updated.

### Gaps & Challenges
- Since debug console logs only print when the debug cookie is active, it protects console cleanliness for standard users while providing rich instrumentation for developers.

## 📅 2026-05-31: Architecture Setup & Sync Rules Update

### What went well
- Created a comprehensive `2_Environment/architecture.md` containing dynamic Mermaid charts showing system components (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Workers, Fly.io, Azure Key Vault, GitHub Actions).
- Standardized rules in `agents.md` and agent profiles instructing teams to update `architecture.md` as soon as system configurations change.

### Gaps & Challenges
- None. Ensuring all components are mapped visually helps human stakeholders and subsequent AI agents maintain correct contextual orientation.

## 📅 2026-05-31: Kanban Maintenance Section Added

### What went well
- Appended the 7-stage folder structure maintenance checklist directly into `1_Real_Unknown/kanban.md` as requested.
- Tracked this update in the logs to maintain proper execution transparency.

### Gaps & Challenges
- None. Having this checklist helps ensure each stage directory is systematically maintained during development runs.

## 📅 2026-07-12: Smoke Test Runner, Menu Backfill & the 7→1 Sanity Loop

### What went well
- The SPEC-008 runner (`5_Symbols/toolbox/smoke_test.py`) proved its worth on its very first cloud run: it caught a real production bug (stage folder links 404 on GitHub Pages) that local checks could not see. The full error workflow was exercised end-to-end — GitHub Issue #1 → fix → error.log/fix.log → VERIFIED → issue closed.
- Making the runner template-adapted (driven by `navigation_config.json`, stdlib only) means every project bootstrapped from this template inherits working smoke tests with zero changes.
- Regenerating all 3 navigation sources from one script eliminated the manual 3-way sync problem that caused R-003; the runner now guards it automatically.

### Gaps & Challenges
- A parallel push race (R-001) occurred mid-cycle when `static.yml` landed on the remote — resolved with `git pull --rebase`, exactly as the documented mitigation prescribes. The mitigation works; keep pushes sequential.
- The deploy workflow (`static.yml`) still deploys unconditionally — wiring the smoke runner in as a gate is the single remaining step to close R-007.
- Lesson: local-only testing gave a false "all green" — the folder-link bug was only visible against the deployed site. Always run both modes, as the Test Agent rule requires.

## 📅 2026-08-14: Multi-Model Redundancy & LLM Auth Provider Resilience

### What went well
- When Claude subscription access was disabled by organization policy during a session with Claude Code, the delivery-pilot-template framework proved its design goal: **Plug & Play Model Resilience**.
- The project's state, specifications (`4_Formula/specs.md`), and progress were fully intact, allowing immediate transition to the Gemini agent (`GEMINI.md`) without losing context or progress.
- Documenting secrets in Azure Key Vault (`dp-kv-deliverypilot`) provides a clean path to use dedicated Anthropic API keys (`ANTHROPIC-API-KEY`) rather than relying purely on interactive OAuth user subscriptions.

### Gaps & Challenges
- Organization subscription policies can change abruptly. Relying on interactive OAuth logins for headless or terminal coding agents creates a single point of failure.

### Takeaway for Future AI Agents
- Always configure API keys in Azure Key Vault as the primary headless execution mode and maintain multi-model capability across Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Kilo Code.
